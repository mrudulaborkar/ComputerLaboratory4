Savitribai Phule Pune University - Final Year of Computer Engineering - Programming Assignments for Computer Laboratory 4 - Mobile Applications &amp; High Performance Computing

This repository contains my assignments for computer laboratory 4 which consists of:

A1 - Using Divide and Conquer Strategies design a cluster/Grid of BBB or Raspberi pi or Computers in network to run a function for Binary Search Tree using C /C++/ Java/Python/ Scala.

A2 - Using Divide and Conquer Strategies design a class for Concurrent Quick Sort using C++.

A3 - rite a MPI program for calculating a quantity called coverage from data.

A4 - Write a program on an unloaded cluster for several different numbers of nodes and record the time taken in each case. Draw a graph of execution time against the number of nodes.

A5 - Build a small compute cluster using Raspberry Pi/BBB modules to implement Booths Multiplication algorithm.

A6 - Write a mobile application to generate a Scientific calculator using J2ME/ Python/ Scala/ C++/ Android.

B1 - 8-Queens Matrix is Stored using JSON/XML having first Queen placed, use back-tracking to place remaining Queens to generate nal 8-queen's Matrix using Python. Create a backtracking scenario and use HPC architecture (Preferably BBB) for computation of next placement of a queen.

B3 - Develop a stack sampling using threads using VTune Amplifier.

B4 - Write a program to check task distribution using Gprof.l

B6 - Implement OBST Tree search using HPC task sub-division. Merge the results to get final result.

C1 - To write a mobile application to perform Palindrome Checking using J2ME/ Python/ Scala/ C++/ Android.

C2 - To write a mobile application to call emergency land-line number/mobile number using gyroscope.

C3 - Design suitable assignment for Mobile Programming. [Optional: to take a snapshot using mobile camera.]
